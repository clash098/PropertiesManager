# 💼 Properties Manager 💼
## What is it's purpose?
This mod is designed to prevent nosey people from seeing your custom properties with mod checkers. The main reason I created this mod is because one of these nosey people came up to me ingame, looked at my chest, said "yoU'rE uSInG baNANA OS, I'm rEPoRTinG yOU!", then proceeded to report me. Hopefully with this mod, things like that don't happen anymore :D
## How is it used?
There are three commands, accessible through the Computer Interface Command Line. Firstly, the `myprops` command: This command shows all of your current custom properties. Secondly, the `clearprops` command: This command clears all of your current custom properties, except `didTutorial` (safe to use in infection).
## What are the dependencies
Properties Manager requires [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx), [Computer Interface](https://github.com/DecalFree/ComputerInterface), and [Computer Interface Command Line](https://github.com/DecalFree/ComputerInterface).
